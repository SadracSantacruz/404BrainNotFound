      Write up: 
      We are analyzing patients across genders in comparing whether 
      there are differences across diseases, medication, admission 
      class, demographics in which sets the two genders statistically apart. 
      We have grouped the data by their gender. We have also grouped the data 
      based on the top 10 diagnostic conditions. We have also made an interactive 
      click to the gender graphs. We currently have a simple version of our idea 
      exploring differences in admission classes for different genders and we have 
      made that into a visualization graph. We are in the process of adding a key 
      to search which medication each group is taking. 

      We think the most challenging part will be the data cleaning 
      (combining the data) and animation for the interactive visualization 
      for different medications. It took a long time for us to connect the 
      two graphs diagnostic condition and gender group data through the interactive
       feature. Thus, making the graph more interactive like adding new features 
      like medication searching would take longer to implement. We think It also 
      will take a long time to find attributes to combine the different data sets 
      to combine the data into one dataset such as combining features like medication
       and patient and procedure. It would take a long time to find the right data set and 
       right variables to merge to make our new features implement smoothly.
